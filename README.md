# Financial Calculator
When preparing for retirement, it is hard to decide how much to save per month to support your retirement goals.

* Break your retirement goals down.  How much money do you want to live off of when you retire (in terms of today's value)? 20k? 50k? 150k?

* In order to live off of that from the age you retire until you die, how much do you need to save per month now?

* The question my calculator answers that you cannot find elsewhere and is non-trivial to calculate, is **inflation**.

* If inflation is around 4%, you retire when you're 65, and you live until you're 87, those 22 years of inflation on your post-retirement savings is significant!

* The annuity calculator will show you what your drawable income is (taking into account inflation until retirement *and* inflation after retirement).

## Calculator
**Present value -** initial value.

**Years (N) -** number of years the present value will be annually compounded.

**Interest Rate (I) -** annually compounding rate.

**Future Value -** the value of the present value after being annually compounded at interest rate (I) for (N) years.


## Annuity
**Present value -** initial capital or dollar amount, typically the amount you currently have invested.

**Years (N) -** number of years the final values will be calculated for, typically years until desired retirement age.

**Payments (AMT) -** amount of payment deposited per frequency period.

**Interest Rate (I) -** annually compounding rate, typically the return on investment (ROI) you can expect to gain over the period.

**Payment Frequency -** frequency the payment is deposited at, typically coinciding with a pay period.

**Future Value -** value of the resulting sum of money, referred to as a nest egg.

**Drawable Income -** annual amount of money that can be withdrawn from the nest egg without diminishing the nest egg, given the ROI without any more payments.  
* This income is in today's money.
* This income assumes no more payments are coming in.
* This income allows for the nest egg to grow enough to compensate for inflation.
* This income is guaranteed until death and for future generations assuming continued ROI.
